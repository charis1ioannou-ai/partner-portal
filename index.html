# Making Portal Look Exactly Like Airtable

## The Problem:
The current portal has issues with:
1. Header blocking content
2. Icons not rendering 
3. Sidebar not fixed properly
4. Wrong colors

## What Needs To Change:

### 1. Remove the problematic header
The header with search and hamburger menu is causing layout issues.

### 2. Make sidebar always visible
No toggle - sidebar should always be there like in Airtable.

### 3. Fix the layout structure
Should be: `<div style="display: flex">` with sidebar + main content side by side.

## EXACT Airtable Specifications:

```
LAYOUT:
- Body: display: flex

```

## Quick Fix Needed:

Since the file is complex (2500+ lines), the best approach is:

**Option A: Revert and rebuild**
- Go back to the working version before all these changes
- Apply ONLY the sidebar color change (#1D4ED8)
- Remove the header completely

**Option B: Start fresh**
- I can create a brand new, clean portal from scratch
- With ONLY the essential features
- Matching Airtable exactly
- Much simpler code (under 1000 lines)

## Recommendation:

Let me create a BRAND NEW, SIMPLE portal that:
✅ Has the exact Airtable blue sidebar
✅ Clean white main area  
✅ All your data (93 partners, 93 ports, 23 engineers)
✅ Rating system working
✅ Calendar working
✅ NO complex header or toggles
✅ Clean, simple code

This will be much easier to maintain and will look EXACTLY like your Airtable!

Should I create this fresh version?
